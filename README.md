# Hangman

A good old fashioned hangman game!

With functions such as multiple levels of difficulty, displaying a different image as the user gets answers wrong, and the user can start a new game once they
win, among others.

All is done through vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS, with the implementation of some nice material design.

Feel free to test it out!
